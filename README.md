# Global CO2 Emissions Dashboard - Tableau Project

## Overview

This project focuses on creating an interactive Tableau dashboard to visualize and analyze global CO2 emissions data. The dashboard provides insights into emissions by country, source, year, and per capita, enabling users to explore historical trends and current patterns.

## Scope

The dashboard will visualize CO2 emissions data at a global level, broken down by:

-   **Country:** Total CO2 emissions per country.
-   **Source:** Emissions by source of CO2 (e.g., Gas, Oil, Coal, etc.).
-   **Year:** Historical data on CO2 emissions from 1740 to the present.
-   **Per Capita Emissions:** CO2 emissions adjusted for population size.

Users can interact with the data, filtering by country, region, and time period to gain customized insights.

## Data Source

-   Maven Analytics Dataset (CSV Files)

## Key Features

-   **Global Emissions Overview:** A world map visualizing total CO2 emissions by country, color-coded to indicate emission magnitude.
-   **Trends Over Time:** A line graph displaying global and regional CO2 emissions trends from 1740 to the most recent year, highlighting growth or reduction.
-   **Country Comparison:** Side-by-side comparison of top emitters, including total and per capita CO2 emissions.
-   **Emission Intensity:** Scatter plot relating emissions with GDP or energy consumption to evaluate emission intensity changes across regions.
-   Interactive filters and drill-down capabilities for detailed analysis.

## Tools Used

-   **Tableau Desktop:** For creating interactive and dynamic visualizations.
-   **CSV Files:** For data wrangling and preparation before importing into Tableau.

## Project Steps

1.  **Data Acquisition and Preparation:**
    -   Download the Maven Analytics CO2 emissions dataset (CSV files).
    -   Clean and preprocess the data as necessary.
    -   Prepare the data for import into Tableau.
2.  **Tableau Dashboard Development:**
    -   Import the prepared data into Tableau Desktop.
    -   Create visualizations as outlined in the "Key Features" section.
    -   Develop interactive filters and parameters for user customization.
    -   Design the dashboard for clear and effective communication of insights.
3.  **Testing and Refinement:**
    -   Test the dashboard for usability and accuracy.
    -   Refine the visualizations and interactions based on testing feedback.
4.  **Deployment (Optional):**
    -   Publish the dashboard to Tableau Public or Tableau Server for sharing.

## Impact

This dashboard provides an accessible platform for tracking and analyzing global CO2 emissions reduction progress. It can assist in:

-   Identifying regions or sectors needing more focus to meet climate goals.
-   Supporting policymakers and businesses in making informed decisions regarding emissions reduction strategies and sustainability initiatives.

## Outcome

The final dashboard will serve as an informative tool for:

-   Environmental researchers.
-   Policymakers.
-   Business leaders.
-   The general public.

It will facilitate a better understanding of the global state of CO2 emissions, track progress, and drive actionable insights towards sustainability.
